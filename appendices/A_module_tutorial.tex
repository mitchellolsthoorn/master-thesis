\chapter{Module tutorial}
    
% This document assumes you have installed all of the dependencies as instructed in the README.md. You will learn how to set up the framework and create your first module.
% 
% \section{Files}
% 
% First we will setup a working directory to run the framework in. This tutorial will place all of its files in the ~/Documents/module\_tutorial directory. You are free to choose whatever directory you want, to place your files in.
% 
% In the working directory, we will now clone FBase through git:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% git clone https://github.com/mitchellolsthoorn/ipv8-module-loader.git
% \end{lstlisting}
% 
% You should see a folder called \textit{ipv8-module-loader} appear in the working directory.
% 
% At the end of this setup step you should have the following files in your working directory:
% 
% (folder) pyipv8
% (file) __init__.py
% (file) main.py
