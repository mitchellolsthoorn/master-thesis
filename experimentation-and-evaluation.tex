\chapter{Experimentation and evaluation}

% - trust explorer example
% - 9 fully functional modules
% - demonstrate the viability of run-time changes and alternative algorithmic approaches
% - open questions:
%   - how do we evaluate this?
%   - how do we show that it works as intended?
%   - we successfully bypassed the Android security model with protection against dynamic code injection using Webview
%   - pure technical (module loading times, memory usage impact, event-driven impact, event processing workload analysis, peak performance estimation)
%   - Github/NodeJS/Debian replacement workload analysis ("github is the largest code host in the world, with 20 million users and more than 57 million repositories"
